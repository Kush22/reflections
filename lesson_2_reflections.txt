1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository using 'git init' it creates a hidden file .git which stores meta-data about the repository. We need it because only then will git be able to review the different versions of the file made.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate between the working directory and the repository. The files from wd are first moved to staging area and from there to the repository. It helps to group files that form a logical unit that can be commited together.
